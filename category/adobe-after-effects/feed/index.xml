<p>I am beginner at learning after effects and after learning the basics about animation and shapes layer I found that very quickly layers to many very quickly. One think that helped me in managing them better is to hide layers which I am not working with and showing only the ones which are important. </p>



<p><strong>Two Techniques that worked best are. </strong><br>1. Show/hide properties<br>2. Shy Layers. </p>



<h2>Show/Hide Layers. </h2>



<p>Suppose you are synchronizing the animations and you only want to see the layers which have keyframes, you can select the layer and hit U key and it will show only the layers which have key frames. I loved this because it clears out all the unwanted layers at the moment. </p>



<p>The following is an excellent tutorial on youtube by Josh Short that explains more shortcuts that can come handy. </p>

<h2>Shy Layers</h2>



<p>Sometimes you might want to work only with two layers and hide all the others and this is super easy and very helpful to remove the complexity while editing a few layers. </p>



<p>See the following tutorial by Baker Tuts. </p>
